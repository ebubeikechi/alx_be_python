# Objective: Use user input, variables, and arithmetic operations to calculate and provide feedback on a userâ€™s monthly savings and potential future savings without applying conditional statements.

monthly_income = int(input("Enter your monthly income: "))
monthly_expenses = int(input("Enter your total monthly expenses: "))
monthly_savings = monthly_income - monthly_expenses

projected_savings = monthly_savings * 12 + (monthly_savings * 12 * 0.05)

print(f"Your monthly savings are ${monthly_savings}.")
print(f"Projected savings after one year, with interest, is: ${int(projected_savings)}.")
