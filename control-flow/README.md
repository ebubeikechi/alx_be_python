0. Weather Recommendation Program
mandatory
Objective: Utilize conditional statements to guide program execution based on user input regarding weather conditions.

Task Description:

Create a Python script named weather_advice.py. This script will ask the user about the current weather conditions and provide clothing recommendations based on the input. This task aims to demonstrate the use of if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in a program.

1. Simple Calculator with Match Case
mandatory
Objective: Learn to use Match Case statements for handling multiple operations in a simple calculator program.

Task Description:

Develop a Python script named match_case_calculator.py. This calculator will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). The script will then perform the selected operation using a Match Case statement and display the result.


2. Multiplication Table Generator
mandatory
Objective: Use a for loop to generate and print the multiplication table for a given number.

Task Description:

Create a Python script named multiplication_table.py. This script will ask the user to enter a number, then use a for loop to print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

3. Drawing Patterns with Nested Loops
mandatory
Objective: Utilize while loops and nested for loops to draw a simple text-based pattern.

Task Description:

Develop a Python script named pattern_drawing.py. This script will prompt the user to enter a positive integer, then use nested loops to print a square pattern of that size made of asterisks (*).


4. Personal Daily Reminder
mandatory
Objective: Create a simplified Python script that uses conditional statements, Match Case, and loops to remind the user about a single, priority task for the day based on time sensitivity.

Task Description:

Develop a script named daily_reminder.py. This script will ask the user for a single task, its priority level, and if it is time-sensitive. The program will then provide a customized reminder for that task, demonstrating control flow and loops without relying on data structures to store multiple tasks.
